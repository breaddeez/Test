	<p><font face="Arial" color="#ffffff" class="shadow"> Bread inc is the company behind many famous movies such as "The NFT Heist" , "The NFT Heist 2" , "Dont Leave me behind" and "Sniper" </p>
	<p> Our company is based in Almaty Kazakhstan and consists of the founders friends and family. Bread inc is also a non-profit organisation mainly due to the</p>
	<p> fact that we are not able to make any money. This company was first created as a joke within smaller movie projects within the credits of which Adam Burrows edited</p>
	<p> because he was bored, but after the inclusion of this after even more movies and projects, it began to grow into a much larger coorperation. We plan to grow</p>
	<p> Bread inc much further and have further plans for movies such as the upcomming "Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde the movie" as well as expand into using more advanced</p>
	<p> Visual effects with the chosen program Blender and Davinci Resolve 17.</p></font>
